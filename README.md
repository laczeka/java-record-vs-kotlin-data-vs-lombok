>Many companies care about code quality by introducing automatic analysis tools. Corporate SonarQube usually has rules configured to monitor code coverage with tests. If your code does not have, for example, 80% test coverage, your build will not pass.
>
>In one of my previous articles, I compared Lombok, Java Record and Kotlin data class. Lombok won in the Java category, but when we use Jacoco to analyze code coverage, it turns out that our logic written using Lombok has poor code coverage. Despite covering all business methods with tests, Jacoco requires us to test the code generated by Lombok!
>
>In my opinion, Lombok has its own tests and duplicating the Lombok code tests again makes no sense.
>
>However, this can be easily fixed by adding the lombok.config file with the entry:
>lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true
>
>In the presented example, the coverage of the PeronLombok class increased from 21% to 100%.
>Your tests should test your business code, not Lombok annotations!


### Basic info
- SpringBoot 3.2
- Java 17
- Maven

The project would not need Spring, but when writing the article I wanted to quickly create a project
